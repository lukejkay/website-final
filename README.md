# Website Project - Portfolio website
## Introduction

My website is going to be a site focusing on a portfolio on some of my previous work, and the skills I have including an online CV.
When designing a website I prefer to use Photoshop for my designs as well as a greyscale design of the layout of the pages. I have included a design of what content will be placed where as well as a detailed design of the header, navigation and footer and a navigation list. All of my designs can be found inside my GitHub folder as well as screenshots placed inside of this document.


## Initial Designs

My website will be responsive therefore there will be designs for the mobile device as well as desktop, there will be no designs for a tablet as this works with the desktop design.

#### Header & Navigation Design
Below is my header design for the desktop. This design will be consistent throughout all of the pages in this website, there will be no change apart from maybe the page that will be open may have a active design like bold text.

#### Footer Design
The footer design will also be a consistent style throughout all of the pages created in this website, the footer is a great way to add quick links which you do not want in the navigation bar, as my website is small with few pages I will only add social links and contact information.
The footer will look consistent throughout the different screen sizes, but at mobile the social icons will be bigger for easier use with fingers on touch screens

## Greyscale Layout of Page Content
I have created a layout of the page content in Photoshop to help me focus on how I want information to be portrayed to the users, I have used rectangles and squares to show where items will go however my final design will be considerably different. Below I have attached the images of my greyscale designs. I designed the mobile first, and the desktop after; Breakpoints will be added in between the 2 sizes where appropriate

## Prototypes
All of my final designs have been designed using Photoshop, this is a great way for me to finalise my design and showcase how I want my final deliverable to be. I have only designed the desktop in final design as the mobile designs are exactly the same just played out differently as can be seen through the greyscale designs.

## JavaScript Included in the website

## API I have used in the website, and my own JSON I have used

## Testing of the website

#### First test Problems
Rollover buttons did not suit the design of the website, they should be in the same style and be a smooth animation - this has been rectified, evidence is shown in the section of CHANGES I HAVE MADE.

#### Changes I have made

My first change was the javascript rollover buttons, I had done JavaScript Rollover buttons to showcase my text manipulation skills in Javascript(The code is still available to view on GitHub), this also allowed me to avoid using backgrounds and changeing the backgrounds in css, but I have changed this to be a more interactive experience for the user by making them graphical and animated
