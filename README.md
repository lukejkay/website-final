# Website Project - Portfolio website

## Introduction

My website is going to be a site focusing on a portfolio on some of my previous work, and the skills I have including an online CV.
When designing a website I prefer to use Photoshop for my designs as well as a greyscale design of the layout of the pages. I have included a design of what content will be placed where as well as a detailed design of the header, navigation and footer and a navigation list. All of my designs can be found inside my GitHub folder as well as screenshots placed inside of this document.


## Initial Designs

My website will be responsive therefore there will be designs for the mobile device as well as desktop, there will be no designs for a tablet as this works with the desktop design.

#### Header & Navigation Design
Below is my header design for the desktop. This design will be consistent throughout all of the pages in this website, there will be no change apart from maybe the page that will be open may have a active design like bold text.
